## How to improve your passing and attacking
 
Passing is one of the most important skills in rugby, as it allows you to create space and exploit gaps in the defence. In Rugby Challenge 3, you can use different types of passes, such as cut out balls, inside balls, pop passes and offloads. Here are some tips on how to use them effectively:

- Don't be afraid to throw a cut out ball here and there. Giving yourself a bit of space is always a good thing[^1^].
- A cut out pass is a long pass that skips one or more players in the line. It can be useful to surprise the defence and create an overlap on the wing.
- An inside ball is a pass that goes behind the receiver's back to another player running a different angle. It can be useful to break through the defence and create a line break.
- A pop pass is a short pass that goes slightly forward or sideways to a player running at speed. It can be useful to maintain momentum and avoid tackles.
- An offload is a pass that is made after being tackled or while being tackled. It can be useful to keep the ball alive and avoid turnovers.
- To perform an offload, you need to press the pass button before hitting the ground or while being held up by a defender.
- Don't commit a man until you think you can stop an offload[^1^]. If you tackle too early, you might leave a gap for the offloader to exploit.

## How to improve your kicking and defending
 
Kicking is another essential skill in rugby, as it allows you to gain territory, relieve pressure, score points and create opportunities. In Rugby Challenge 3, you can use different types of kicks, such as punts, grubbers, drop goals and conversions. Here are some tips on how to use them effectively:

- Don't be afraid to kick the ball up field. It's often easy to get it back[^1^]. A well-placed kick can put pressure on the opposition and force them to make mistakes.
- A punt is a high kick that goes forward or sideways. It can be useful to chase and contest for possession or to find touch.
- A grubber is a low kick that rolls along the ground. It can be useful to get behind the defence or to set up a try.
- A drop goal is a kick that goes over the crossbar from open play. It can be useful to score points when other options are not available.
- A conversion is a kick that goes over the crossbar after scoring a try. It can be useful to add extra points and increase your lead.
- To score a conversion, it's all about timing! Stop the marker over the black bar in middle and judge the wind correctly[^1^].
- To defend against kicks, always have someone ready in position[^1^]. You can use the right stick to switch players and position them under the ball.
